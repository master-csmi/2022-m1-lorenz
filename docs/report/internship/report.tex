	\section{Introduction}
	
	\noindent This internship is the continuation of a project realised in th platform Cemosis . During the project the main goals were to implement a parallel-in-time resolution method for the Lorenz system, to realize the data assimilation using the EnKF method using a function already implemented in the library Filterpy. For this we also had to implement several methods to solve numerically the Lorenz system (like RK4). During the project, all these methods were implemented or used in Python.
	
	\subsection{Presentation of Cemosis}
	\label{cemosis}
	
	This project is managed by Cemosis which is the "Centre de Modélisation et de Simulation de Strasbourg" (Strasbourg Modeling and Simulation Center). Cemosis is hosted by the Institute of Advanced Mathematical Research (IRMA) and was created in January 2013. 
	Cemosis work is focused on the numarical simulation and mathematical modeling of different phenomena. They use and develop tools in the fields of:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
		\item \textbf{MSO} - Modeling Simulation and Optimization
		\item \textbf{DS} -	Data Science, Big Data, Smart Data
		\item \textbf{HPC} - High Performance Computing, Parallel Computing, Cloud Computing
		\item \textbf{SI} - Signal and Image processing
	\end{enumerate}
	\noindent They work with researchers and engineers of other research centers and companies.
	
	\noindent For more informations, refer to the \href{http://www.cemosis.fr/}{cemosis website}. 
	\subsection{Context}
	\noindent Cemosis relies currently on the team Modeling and Control of the IRMA and is developing competences and projects in the energy sector of buildings. Nowadays it is important to reduce the energy consumption of buildings in order to move to a more ecologic and economic lifestyle. For this we need to know how to simulate and model buildings using fast simulation methods such as parallel calculation and data integration because our models used to simulate buildings are never perfect, and even less in the case of existing buildings where we have little information. In fact, in order to perform simulations over long periods, such as a year, we would also have to take into consideration phenomena such as radiative exchanges and convective effects, which therefore require a PDE model if we want a spatial discretization.

	\section{Differential Equations}
	\noindent In Mathematics, ordinary differential equations (ODE) are equations that involve derivatives of one-variable functions, and partial differential equations (PDE) are equations that imposes relations between the various partial derivatives of a multivariable function.
	The difference between ODEs and PDEs is that for ODEs the unknown functions depend only on one variable, whereas for PDEs the unknown functions may depend on several independent variables.
	\noindent Differential equations are an important object of study in both pure and applied mathematics. They are used to build mathematical models of physical and biological evolution processes, for example for the study of radioactivity, celestial mechanics, weather or population dynamics... 
	\noindent During the project we had already used the Lorenz system and the harmonic oscillator, for the internship we also used these two differential equations but we worked with two other equations: the heat equation and the Laplacian.
	
	\subsection{ODE: Harmonic oscillator}
	\label{oscillator_ode}
	\noindent A harmonic oscillator is an ideal oscillator whose evolution over time is described by a sinusoidal function, whose frequency depends only on the characteristics of the system and whose amplitude is constant.This mathematical model describes the evolution of any physical system in the vicinity of a stable equilibrium position, which makes it a transversal tool used in many fields: mechanics, electricity and electronics, optics.
	\begin{figure}[H]       
	\begin{minipage}[t]{0.46\linewidth}

		\captionof{figure}{Spring/mass system}
	\end{minipage}
    \end{figure}
	
	\newpage
	
	\noindent Let's consider a mass-spring system of the following form :

    \begin{equation}
    	\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2}+\omega_0^2 x = 0 \quad \iff \quad \frac{d^2 x}{d t^2}=-\omega_0^2 x \quad \text{with} \quad \omega_0=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
    	\label{osc}
    \end{equation}
    
    \noindent $k$ and $m$ are the spring stiffness and the suspended mass respectively. We are interested in this equation because its exact solution is known and is of the form :
    $$x(t) = x_0 \cos(\omega_{0}t+\phi_0).$$
    
    \noindent First of all, the numerical methods such as Runge Kutta order 4  allow us to solve first order differential equations. But the harmonic oscillator equation (\ref{osc}) is a second order equation. We will therefore start by making a simple change of variable which will allow us to replace this second order differential equation by a system of two first order equations. We pose :
     
    $$\qquad \frac{d x}{d t}=v \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d^2 x}{d t^2}=\frac{d v}{d t}.$$
    
    \noindent As a result the equation becomes :
    
    $$\left\{\;\begin{aligned}
    	\frac{d x}{d t}&=v \\
    	\frac{d v}{d t}&=-\omega_0^2 x
    \end{aligned}\right.
    $$
    
    \noindent Let's take an example to understand how we can determine the exact solution from the initial conditions that we will take. For example if we take $\omega_0=5$ and $(x(0),v(0))=(0,1)$, we have :
    
    $$\left\{\;\begin{aligned}
    	x(0)&=0 \\
    	v(0)&=1
    \end{aligned}\right. \quad \Rightarrow 
    \left\{\;\begin{aligned}
    	x_0 \cos(\phi_0)&=0 \\
    	-x_0 \omega_{0} \sin(\phi_0)&=1
    \end{aligned}\right.  \quad \Rightarrow  
    \left\{\;\begin{aligned}
    	x_0&=\frac{-1}{5} \\
    	\phi_0&=\frac{\pi}{2}
    \end{aligned}\right.
    $$
    
    \noindent And thus the solutions of the equation are of the form :
    
    $$x(t) = \frac{-1}{5}\cos(5t+\frac{\pi}{2}).$$
    \subsection{ODE: Lorenz system}
	\label{lorenz_ode}
	\noindent The Lorenz system is a simplified three-variable model to investigate atmospheric convection. This model has had important repercussions in showing the possible limits on the ability to predict long-term climate and weather evolution. One of the important characteristics of the Lorenz system is 
	that it is a chaotic system, which means that this type of system is roughly defined by sensitivity to initial conditions: infinitesimal differences in initial conditions of the system result in large differences in behavior.
	\begin{figure}[H]   
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{"images/butterfly.jpg"}
		\caption{butterfly wing pattern}
		\label{but_wing}
	\end{figure}	
	
	\noindent The Lorenz system defines a 3 dimensional trajectory by differential equations with 3 parameters.
	$$
	\begin{cases}
		
		x'&=\sigma(y-x) \\
		y'&=x(r-z)-y \\
		z'&=xy-bz
		
	\end{cases}
	$$
	
	\noindent Here, $x$ is proportional to the rate of convection, $y$ is related to the horizontal temperature variation, and $z$ is the vertical temperature variation.
	We have also three parameters all strictly positive:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
		\item $\sigma > 0$  relates to the Prandtl number. This number is a dimensionless quantity that puts the viscosity of a fluid in correlation with the thermal conductivity;
		\item $r > 0$  relates to the Rayleigh number, it is a control parameter, representing the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the tank;
		\item $b > 0$ relates to the physical dimensions of the layer of fluid uniformly heated from below and cooled from above.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\noindent We can see that this system is non-linear, because in the second differential equation ( $\frac{dy}{dt}$) we can see the term $xz$ and in the third differential equation ($\frac{dz}{dt}$) we have $xy$. The three differential equations form a coupled system. 
	
	\noindent Let us now determine the fixed points of the Lorenz system. These are the points such that $X'=0$. 
	
	$$
	X'=(x',y',z')=0
	\quad \Rightarrow \quad 
	\left\{\begin{aligned}
		x'=&\sigma(y-x) &&=0 \\
		y'=&x(r-z)-y  &&=0\\
		z'=&xy-bz &&=0
	\end{aligned}\right. 
	\quad \Rightarrow \quad 
	\left\{\begin{aligned}
		&x=y \\
		&(r-1-z)x=0\\
		&x^2=bz
	\end{aligned}\right.
	$$
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
		\item If $x=0$ : \quad  $y=0$ and $z=0$.
		\item If $x\ne 0$ and $r>1$ : \quad $\left\{\begin{aligned}
			&z=r-1\\
			&x=y=\pm\sqrt{b(r-1)}
		\end{aligned}\right.
		$
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\noindent We deduce that the fixed points of the Lorenz system are: $(0,0,0)$ for all values of the parameters. And for $r>1$, there is also a pair of fixed points $(\sqrt{b(r-1)},\sqrt{b(r-1)},r-1)$ and $(-\sqrt{b(r-1)},-\sqrt{b(r-1)},r-1)$.
	
	\subsection{PDE: Laplacian equation}
	\label{laplacian_pde}
    \noindent The Laplace equation is a second-order partial differential equation . This equation is a basic PDE that arises in the heat and diffusion equations. It is a useful method for determining electric potentials in space or the free region.
    It is often written as :
    $$\Delta f=0 \qquad \text{or} \qquad \nabla^2 f=0$$
    \noindent with $\Delta$ the Laplace operator. We can define the Laplace operator as follows: $\Delta=\nabla \cdot \nabla$ where $\nabla \cdot$ divergence operator and $\nabla$  is the gradient operator.
    
    \noindent We can write the problem this way:
    
	$$\left\{\begin{aligned}
		-\Delta u &= f \quad&&\Omega \\
		u&=g \quad&&\Gamma_D \\
		\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &=h \quad &&\Gamma_N \\
		\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}+u &=l \quad &&\Gamma_R \\
	\end{aligned}\right.$$
	\noindent Where $\Omega$ corresponds to our domain, $\Gamma_D$  corresponds to the Dirichlet boundary condition, $\Gamma_N$ to the Neumann boundary condition and $\Gamma_R$ to the Robin boundary condition.
	\subsection{PDE: Heat equation}
	\label{heat_pde}
	\noindent Heat transfer is the process of energy transfer resulting from a temperature difference. 
	\newline
    \noindent Thermal analysis is undertaken to predict temperatures and heat transfer in and around bodies. This information can then be used to model temperature-dependent phenomena, such as heat-induced stresses or the effect on fluid flow in the case of a solidifying metal.  Heat flow has been classified into three different modes: conduction, convection and radiation.

	\end{minipage}
	\captionof{figure}{Simulation of the temperature of a building using the heat equation with Feel++}
    \end{figure}


	\noindent The heat equation with convective effects can be written as:
    $$\rho C_p((\frac{\partial T}{\partial t})+u . \nabla T)-\nabla .(k \nabla T)=Q$$
    and it must be completed  with boundary conditions and initial conditions.

    \subsection{Runge-Kutta}
    \label{rk4}
    \noindent During our project and internship we used the Runge-Kutta method of order 4 to solve ordinary differential equations. Runge-Kutta techniques are one-step numerical schemes for solving ordinary differential equations. They are among the most popular methods because of their ease of implementation and accuracy.
    
    \noindent We consider $f : [0; T] \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ a continuous function. For $X_0\in \mathbb{R}^n$, the problem is to find  $X\in C^1([0,T],\mathbb{R}^n)$ solution for the differential equation:
	
	$$\left\{\begin{aligned}
		X'&=f(t,X), \\
		X(0)&=X_0.
	\end{aligned}\right.$$
	
	
	 \noindent After discretizing the problem in time, we can use the Runge Kutta method of order 4 to solve the ODE:
		
		$$X_{n+1}=X_n+\frac{\Delta t}{6}\left(K_1+2K_2+2K_3+K_4\right) ,$$
		
		\noindent where 
		
		$$\left\{\begin{aligned}
			K_1&=f(t_n,X_n) , \\
			K_2&=f\left(t_n+\frac{\Delta t}{2},X_n+\frac{1}{2} K_1\Delta t\right) , \\
			K_3&=f\left(t_n+\frac{\Delta t}{2},X_n+\frac{1}{2} K_2\Delta t\right) , \\
			K_4&=f\left(t_n+\Delta t,X_n+K_3\Delta t\right) .
		\end{aligned}\right.$$
	
    

	%\noindent For the next part of the project, we choose to work with the Runge kutta method.

	\section{Conclusion}
	\noindent Our goal during the project was to implement a parallel time resolution method for the Lorenz system, and to realize the data assimilation using the EnKF method.
	For the internship which is a continuation of the project, we had to implement these two methods in C++ in order to integrate and test them with Feel++.
	\noindent We had to implement the parareel method and the data assimilation in order to test them with ODEs like the harmonic oscillator or the Lorenz system but also with PDEs like the heat equation or the Laplacian. Since the implementation was already done in Python during the project, we could check the results obtained with C++ and compare them with those obtained in Python.
	
	\noindent For the parareel part...
	
	\noindent For the data assimilation part, we first had to realize the implementation of the Ensemble Kalman Filter algorithm in C++ based on the one already done in Python in the FilterPy library. We were able to compare the results by applying it to the Lorenz system to verify our algorithm. After making sure that our EnKF in C++ was working properly, we had to understand the heat equation in order to perform a thermal simulation of an office located at the UFR. Furthermore, we had data from the sensors in the office at our disposition. Using the simulation performed with Feel++ as the model and the data as the observations, we had to perform data assimilation to correct the model. We noticed that there were some incorrect values during this part, but due to lack of time we did not manage to correct our algorithm. For the future, it would be interesting to look further into the problem we had during the realization of the data assimilation. Another point to reconsider will be the simulation made with Feel++, as explained before, when we realized the simulation with the toolboxes available in Feel++, we had ignored the convective effects, so maybe we could try to do the simulation by introducing the convective effects.
