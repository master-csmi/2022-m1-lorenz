= Data assimilation method 

The project is configured to integrate VSCode using Docker Container.

The Docker image can be set from `feelpp/feelpp` or `feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes`, simply edit `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and choose the image you want.

`ssh-keyscan` is used on `github.com` to register the public key of github in $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts and avoid having git auth issues the first time we log into the container and push/pull to/from github.

The following extensions are installed in Docker:

* cpptools
* cmaketools
* cmake
* asciidoctor-vscode
