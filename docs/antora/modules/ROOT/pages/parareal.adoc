= Parareal method

Para-real method is a parallel-in-time integration method which was introduced in 2001 by Lions, Maday and Turinici (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parareal#Parallel-in-time_integration_methods[Parareal]). Parareal computes the numerical solution for multiple time steps in parallel and it is categorized as a parallel-across-the-steps method.
